# Rekoni 
React-based front end for a full-stack image recognition service. Rekoni is built around various open-source AI models from  [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com/explore/models). <br><br>
Use the following credentials to demo functionality if you choose not to register an account: 
<br> - email: test (at) rekoni.onrender.com
<br> - pw: test
<br><br>
Note: Rekoni's backend is currently hosted on the free tier of Render, which is not an always-on service. Assuming no activity in the prior 15 minutes, initital login may take a moment as Rekoni spins up the instance hosting the backend. <br><br>
